Jace DeGraw here,

I spent one hour trying to get my changes to be seen by "git status." Turns out my Auto Save was not on. Turned it on now it works great.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged folders by week. There is also an an empty sandbox project that can be used to play around with any concept you would like.
